# ADR001 - Feature-Based Architecture for Calibration Panel

**Date:** 2024-06-08  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision:** Organize code into cohesive feature modules for better maintainability and team collaboration

## Context

The Calibration Panel v1.0 is a real-time AI inference monitoring system that processes WebSocket streams and provides visualization for diagnostic purposes. The current structure mixes concerns across components, making it difficult for teams to work independently on different features.

## Current Architecture Issues

1. **Mixed Concerns**: Components directly import from multiple unrelated modules
2. **Shared State**: All state managed in a single store without clear boundaries
3. **Tight Coupling**: Canvas, metrics, timeline, and events are interdependent
4. **Scaling Challenges**: Adding new features requires touching multiple files

## Decision

Refactor into feature-based modules with clear boundaries:

```
client/src/
├── features/
│   ├── canvas/           # Spatial visualization feature
│   ├── metrics/          # Live metrics and monitoring
│   ├── timeline/         # Historical data visualization
│   ├── events/           # Event logging and display
│   └── connection/       # WebSocket management
├── shared/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── hooks/            # Common hooks
│   └── utils/            # Utility functions
└── app/                  # Application shell
```

## Feature Boundaries

### Canvas Feature
- **Responsibility**: Spatial visualization of detections, tracks, and regions
- **State**: Canvas settings, visualization toggles
- **Dependencies**: Connection data only
- **Team**: Visualization specialists

### Metrics Feature
- **Responsibility**: Real-time system metrics and performance indicators
- **State**: FPS, confidence, detection counts
- **Dependencies**: Connection data stream
- **Team**: Performance monitoring specialists

### Timeline Feature
- **Responsibility**: Historical data visualization (2-minute buffer)
- **State**: Timeline data arrays, chart configurations
- **Dependencies**: Processed metrics data
- **Team**: Data visualization specialists

### Events Feature
- **Responsibility**: Event logging, filtering, and display
- **State**: Event log, filters, export functionality
- **Dependencies**: Tracker events from connection
- **Team**: Logging and monitoring specialists

### Connection Feature
- **Responsibility**: WebSocket management, data streaming
- **State**: Connection status, data distribution
- **Dependencies**: None (core infrastructure)
- **Team**: Infrastructure specialists

## Benefits

1. **Team Independence**: Each feature can be developed separately
2. **Clear Ownership**: Distinct responsibilities per feature
3. **Easier Testing**: Isolated feature testing
4. **Scalability**: Add new features without affecting existing ones
5. **Code Reuse**: Shared components reduce duplication

## Implementation Plan

1. Create feature directories and move existing components
2. Extract feature-specific state from global store
3. Implement feature communication through well-defined interfaces
4. Update imports and dependencies
5. Create feature-specific documentation

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better code organization
- Improved team productivity
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Clear separation of concerns

**Negative:**
- Initial refactoring effort
- Potential temporary complexity during migration
- Need to establish clear communication patterns between features

## Compliance

This decision aligns with:
- Domain-Driven Design principles
- Microservices architecture patterns
- Component-based development best practices
