# MT001 - Feature-Based Architecture Implementation

**Date:** 2024-06-08  
**Type:** Technical Memory  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Overview

Successfully implemented a feature-based architecture for the Calibration Panel v1.0, organizing code into cohesive modules that can be developed and maintained independently by specialized teams.

## Architecture Structure

```

## Feature Boundaries & Responsibilities

### Connection Feature
- **Ownership**: Infrastructure team
- **State**: WebSocket connection status
- **Exports**: `useConnectionStore`, `WebSocketManager`
- **Dependencies**: None (core infrastructure)

### Canvas Feature  
- **Ownership**: Visualization team
- **State**: Current inference/tracker data, visualization toggles
- **Exports**: `useCanvasStore`, `SpatialCanvas`
- **Dependencies**: Connection data streams

### Metrics Feature
- **Ownership**: Performance monitoring team  
- **State**: FPS, confidence, detection counts, keypoint status
- **Exports**: `useMetricsStore`
- **Dependencies**: Raw inference and tracker data

### Timeline Feature
- **Ownership**: Data visualization team
- **State**: 720-point rolling buffer (2 minutes at 6 FPS)
- **Exports**: `useTimelineStore`
- **Dependencies**: Processed metrics data

### Events Feature
- **Ownership**: Logging team
- **State**: Event log, filtering, export functionality
- **Exports**: `useEventsStore`
- **Dependencies**: Tracker events

## Data Flow Architecture

```
WebSocket Stream â†’ Data Coordinator â†’ Feature Stores â†’ UI Components
```

### Data Coordinator Pattern
The `data-coordinator.ts` acts as the central hub:
1. Manages WebSocket lifecycle
2. Distributes data to appropriate feature stores
3. Handles cross-feature data transformations
4. Maintains feature isolation

### Communication Patterns
- **Downward Data Flow**: WebSocket â†’ Coordinator â†’ Stores â†’ Components
- **State Updates**: Each feature manages its own state independently
- **Cross-Feature Dependencies**: Minimal, handled through coordinator

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Management
```typescript
interface WebSocketEvents {
  onConnect: () => void;
  onDisconnect: () => void;
  onInferenceData: (data: InferenceData) => void;
  onTrackerData: (data: TrackerData) => void;
  onFpsUpdate: (fps: number) => void;
}
```

### Timeline Buffer Configuration
- **Capacity**: 720 data points
- **Duration**: 2 minutes (120 seconds Ã— 6 FPS)
- **Update Pattern**: Rolling buffer with shift/push operations

### Canvas Visualization Settings
- Raw bounding boxes (red)
- Smoothed tracks (green) 
- Keypoints (yellow with confidence opacity)
- Regions (blue translucent with real geometry)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Team Independence**: Features can be developed in parallel
2. **Clear Ownership**: Each team has distinct responsibilities
3. **Maintainability**: Isolated feature logic reduces coupling
4. **Testability**: Individual features can be tested independently
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing ones

## Migration Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Feature directory structure
- Connection management refactoring
- Canvas feature isolation
- Store separation for metrics, timeline, events
- Data coordinator implementation

ðŸ”„ **In Progress:**
- Legacy component migration
- Cross-feature communication optimization

ðŸ“‹ **Pending:**
- Feature-specific documentation
- Unit tests for individual features
- Performance optimization

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size**: Slight increase due to store separation
- **Runtime Performance**: Improved due to reduced re-renders
- **Memory Usage**: More efficient with isolated state management
- **Development Experience**: Significantly improved with clear boundaries

## Future Enhancements

1. **Feature Lazy Loading**: Load features on demand
2. **Feature Plugins**: Plugin architecture for extensibility  
3. **Feature Testing**: Individual feature test suites
4. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generated feature docs

## Lessons Learned

1. **State Boundaries**: Clear state ownership prevents conflicts
2. **Data Coordinator**: Central orchestration simplifies complex data flows
3. **Incremental Migration**: Gradual feature extraction maintains stability
4. **Type Safety**: Shared types ensure feature compatibility

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the evolution from v1.0 to v2.0 (Playback and Analysis) by allowing timeline and playback features to be developed independently while maintaining system cohesion.
